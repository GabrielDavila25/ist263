        <h2>Mars Rovers</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
        <p>
          The primary objective of the Mars Rovers, including Spirit,
          Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, is to explore the Martian
          surface and study its geology in detail. These rovers aim to
          understand the planet's environment and seek signs of past or present
          life, helping pave the way for future human exploration.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Evidence of ancient water flows in river valleys and lakebeds.
          </li>
          <li>Detection of key organic compounds in Martian rocks.</li>
          <li>
            Discovering the role of water in the planet's geology with findings
            of hydrated minerals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recent atmospheric measurements by Perseverance indicated intriguing
            chemistry hinting at possible past life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While each Mars Rover was designed for a specific mission duration,
          many surpassed expectations. For example, Opportunity was supposed to
          last 90 Martian days but continued its mission for nearly 15 years!

        <h2>Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Objetive: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope's primary mission is to
          observe the most distant stars and galaxies, providing a deep view
          into the universe's history. With its unparalleled resolution, Hubble
          aims to study the formation of planets, stars, and galaxies, as well
          as the nature of black holes and the mysteries of dark matter.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Captured the iconic "Pillars of Creation" image, showcasing
            star-forming regions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Observed supernovae in distant galaxies, helping in the discovery
            that the universe's expansion is accelerating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Detected exoplanets and their atmospheres, changing our
            understanding of planets outside our solar system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offered the deepest view of the universe, capturing images of
            galaxies billions of light-years away

          The Hubble Space Telescope has observed over 38,000 celestial objects
          and has been the basis for more than 15,000 scientific papers, making
          it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built.

        <h2>Voyager Program</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
        <p>
          Launched in 1977, the twin Voyager spacecraft—Voyager 1 and Voyager
          2—are on an epic journey to extend NASA's exploration of the outer
          planets and beyond. Their primary mission was to take advantage of a
          rare planetary alignment to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
          up close. Beyond that, they aim to push the boundaries of interstellar
          space, sending back data about the heliosphere's outer limits and
          interstellar space.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First detailed images and data of Jupiter's and Saturn's moons,
            rings, and magnetospheres.
          </li>
          <li>Discoveries of 22 new moons around the outer planets.</li>
          <li>Revealed active volcanism on Jupiter’s moon Io.</li>
          <li>
            First spacecraft to encounter Uranus and Neptune, uncovering new
            details about these distant planets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, providing the first
            direct measurements of this environment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object from Earth, and both
          Voyagers carry a golden record with sounds and images intended to
          convey the diversity of life and culture on Earth, just in case they
          are ever found by intelligent life forms in space.
