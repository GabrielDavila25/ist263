      <h2>Mars Rovers</h2>
      <p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
      <p>
        The primary objective of the Mars Rovers, including Spirit,
        Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, is to explore the Martian
        surface and study its geology in detail. These rovers aim to
        understand the planet's environment and seek signs of past or present
        life, helping pave the way for future human exploration.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
      <ul class="keydisc">
        <li>
          Evidence of ancient water flows in river valleys and lakebeds.
        </li>
        <li>Detection of key organic compounds in Martian rocks.</li>
        <li>
          Discovering the role of water in the planet's geology with findings
          of hydrated minerals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recent atmospheric measurements by Perseverance indicated intriguing
          chemistry hinting at possible past life.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Did You Know?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While each Mars Rover was designed for a specific mission duration,
        many surpassed expectations. For example, Opportunity was supposed to
        last 90 Martian days but continued its mission for nearly 15 years!

    <section id="hubble-space-telescope">
      <h2>Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Objetive: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope's primary mission is to
        observe the most distant stars and galaxies, providing a deep view
        into the universe's history. With its unparalleled resolution, Hubble
        aims to study the formation of planets, stars, and galaxies, as well
        as the nature of black holes and the mysteries of dark matter.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
      <ul class="keydisc">
        <li>
          Captured the iconic "Pillars of Creation" image, showcasing
          star-forming regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Observed supernovae in distant galaxies, helping in the discovery
          that the universe's expansion is accelerating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Detected exoplanets and their atmospheres, changing our
          understanding of planets outside our solar system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offered the deepest view of the universe, capturing images of
          galaxies billions of light-years away
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Hubble Space Telescope has observed over 38,000 celestial objects
        and has been the basis for more than 15,000 scientific papers, making
        it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built.

    <section id="voyager-program">
      <h2>Voyager Program</h2>
      <p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
      <p>
        Launched in 1977, the twin Voyager spacecraft—Voyager 1 and Voyager
        2—are on an epic journey to extend NASA's exploration of the outer
        planets and beyond. Their primary mission was to take advantage of a
        rare planetary alignment to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
        up close. Beyond that, they aim to push the boundaries of interstellar
        space, sending back data about the heliosphere's outer limits and
        interstellar space.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Discoveries: </strong></p>
      <ul class="keydisc">
        <li>
          First detailed images and data of Jupiter's and Saturn's moons,
          rings, and magnetospheres.
        </li>
        <li>Discoveries of 22 new moons around the outer planets.</li>
        <li>Revealed active volcanism on Jupiter’s moon Io.</li>
        <li>
          First spacecraft to encounter Uranus and Neptune, uncovering new
          details about these distant planets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, providing the first
          direct measurements of this environment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object from Earth, and both
        Voyagers carry a golden record with sounds and images intended to
        convey the diversity of life and culture on Earth, just in case they
        are ever found by intelligent life forms in space.
